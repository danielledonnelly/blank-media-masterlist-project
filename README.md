# blank-media-masterlist-project
This is a blank template version of my first Get Coding project! 

I've always loved using spreadsheets to keep track of my favourite games, so I want to make a simple editable table that can be used to rank various pieces of media.

Right now I'm just in the very preliminary design stages, but there are lots of features and functionalities I'd like to add in the future.
